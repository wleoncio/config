# config

This is a repository containing some configuration files I use across my computers. Hopefully this is useful for someone else.

# Usage

Just browse the repository and hand-pick the code you want. To make my own life easier, I've created the `syncconfig.sh` script to manually sync these files between my system and a local clone of this repository. You can use it on Linux, but I'd strongly advise against it at this point, as it is a destructive and ad-hoc operation.
