# Introduction

This is a repository containing some configuration files I use across my computers. It helps me sync files across PCs, but hopefully this is useful to someone else.

# Usage

Just browse the repository and hand-pick the code you want. To make my own life easier, I've created the `syncconfig.sh` script to manually sync these files between my system and a local clone of this repository. You can use that script on your own Linux installation, though I'd strongly advise against it at this point, since there are currently no file-overwriting confirmation dialog in place.
